To make a Chatbot, named Happy, deployed on DigitalOcean Platform, which targets to help depressed and emotionally disturbed people. Major issues:
1) These people don't express and share their feelings. Hence, they need counsellors (who are very expensive for each visit).
2) Myths associated with depression causes embarrassment in people and stops them from going to counsellors.

Happy is more like a counsellor in form of friend who interact with user/patient and classify the level of depression .Hence, like a counsellor, the bot will start motivating the user and make him realise the beauty and importance of life.

Due to time constraints, there is flow that our bot follows. Please make sure to follow the flow. Otherwise unexpected behaviour could be seen.
